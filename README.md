# TeoNotes

This site is dedicated to showcasing the interconnected content of my notes, which serve as the backbone for my TeoBot project. Here, you'll find a curated collection of insights and information that I've compiled over time. Each note is carefully linked and related to others, creating a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base. This repository not only supports the development of TeoBot by providing rich, contextual data but also offers a peek into the thought process behind building a personal assistant chatbot. Explore, discover, and perhaps find inspiration for your own projects!
